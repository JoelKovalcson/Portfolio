            <p>Reminiscing on my childhood, I was always fascinated by technology in various mediums ranging from game
                systems to personal computers. To me these devices were simply toys at the time, something to play a
                game on. Lo and behold, I later realized that my methodical and persistent nature were helping me
                develop critical thinking skills. Combining these skills with the aptitude I had for mathematics and
                sciences, and the direction I chose to pursue for an occupation should come as no surprise.<br><br>
                When I first arrived at college, my goals were to obtain a degree in computer engineering. Along this
                path I discovered the joys of programming and it was an instant hit for me, so much so that I swapped to
                pursue computer science. I craved to learn more about programming on both a fundamental and technical
                level.<br><br>
                If you hadn't figured it out, I can be a bit of a nerd. I frequently enjoy topics about various
                technobabble like how threading and scheduling affect runtimes over something like what the latest
                football game results were. However, I also enjoy taking a few steps away from the glowing screens and
                clacking keyboards to go out and enjoy nature.</p>
