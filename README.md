# Portfolio

## Description

The foundation for this project was provided by an online bootcamp for [Full-Stack Development](https://bootcamps.vanderbilt.edu/coding/online/landing/). 

You can view the live project [here](https://joelkovalcson.github.io/Portfolio/).

The minimum criteria for this project was to create a portfolio webpage from scratch. I was provided with a mock-up image and a few listed requirements: 
* Include your name and photo.
* Include a navigation bar that links to sections of the website
* Sections to include: 
  - About Me
  - Work
  - Contact Me
* Work section includes titled images of my projects and other work
* First Work image needs to be larger than the others
* Clicking on any work image takes you to the deployed application
* Must be responsive to different viewport sizes

## What I Did

I undertook this in a top-to-bottom approach minus a bit of outlining at the beginning. I started with the nav bar before working on the banner, then moving to about me and so on. After I had finished working on the entire webpage, I worked on the responsive design for different viewport sizes, settling on a couple of resolution breakpoints to use.
